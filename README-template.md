## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


This was the biggest challenge for me so far, I still didn't know how to use the CSS grid and this challenge made me chase that knowledge!


```css
.cards {
  grid-template-columns: 45px auto;
  grid-template-rows: 16px 16px auto minmax(auto, 1fr);
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to continue improving myself in frontend, especially in semantics, responsiveness and interactivity

### Useful resources
